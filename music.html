            <p>Two decades ago, my musical journey began with a guitar. </p>
            <p>From recording on a vintage tape player in my teenage years, technology has since transformed the landscape.</p>
            <p>Today, I harness the power of Ableton Live 11 Suite and MIDI to craft professional-grade audioâ€”solo.</p>
            <p>Having already released an EP and numerous singles, my aim this year is to unveil a new track every month.</p>
             <p>If you're curious about my work, please visit my <a href="http://linktr.ee/urkle">linktree</a>. </p>
             <p>Whether you wish to presave the upcoming release or groove to my recent track, I guarantee you'll enjoy both!</p>
