            <p>I started off playing guitar around 15 years ago</p>
            <p>With the advancement of technology, recording your own music has become much easier</p>
            <p>I can remember recording on an old tape player I had as a teenager</p>
            <p>Now i use Ableton Live 11 Suite to produce professional quality audio</p>
            <p>With the use of midi it makes it even easier to make a full recording by yourself</p>
            <p>Now ive release a single on spotify with a full ep to be released soon!</p>
            <p>I've also combined my music with my visual art to create NFTs</p>
