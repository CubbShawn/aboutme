            <p>I started off playing guitar around 20 years ago</p>
            <p>With the advancement of technology, recording your own music has become much easier</p>
            <p>I can remember recording on an old tape player I had as a teenager</p>
            <p>Now i use Ableton Live 11 Suite to produce professional quality audio</p>
            <p>With the use of midi it makes it even easier to make a full recording by yourself</p>
            <p>Now ive release an EP and multiple singles publicly. </p>
            <p>MY goal for this year is to release 1 single per month</p>
            <p>If youre interested you can check out my <a href="http://linktr.ee/shawncubb">linktree</a></p>
            <p>Here you can find a link to presave my next single or listen to the last drop. Theyre both dope!</p>
