            <p>I had a background in restaraunt management and customer service</p>
            <p>I've ran businesses with teams of 10 - 50+ people</p> 
            <p>Always fostering a team mentality and an openess within the business</p> 
            <p>Doing this gave the team more ownership and a value to their contributions</p> 
            <p>All while helping grow sales and create a bigger customer base</p> 
            <p>The key to this was ensuring the employees were valued</p>
            <p>I believe this transfers over to any type of business or community</p>
