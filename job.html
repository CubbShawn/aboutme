                <h2>Before Web3</h2>
            </div>
            <p>With a background in restaurant management and customer service, I've led businesses with teams ranging from 10 to over 50 individuals. </p>
            <p>Central to my approach is fostering a team-oriented culture, emphasizing transparency and valuing every member's contribution.</p>
            <p>This leadership style not only bolstered team ownership but also contributed to increased sales and an expanding customer base. </p>
            <p>I firmly believe that valuing employees is a universal key to success, applicable across diverse businesses and communities.</p>
