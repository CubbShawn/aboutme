    <p>I transitioned from a project manager to a community manager, and for the past two years, I've served as the Community Steward for Aragon DAO.</p>
    <p>Within this role, I collaborated closely with the Growth Team, driving community engagement and growth.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about music production and visual arts.</p>
    <p>After years of honing my craft, I've begun releasing my music to the public, including an EP and several singles.</p>
